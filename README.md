The dataset's richness in film-related information allows for comprehensive analysis and exploration of correlations between genres, revenues, audience characteristics, and critical reception, serving as a robust foundation for deriving actionable insights to guide Microsoft's movie studio endeavors.
We are going to be checking the data for the following:

a.Determine the number of records 

b.Preview top and bottom of our dataset

c.Check whether each column has an appropriate data type

## 4. Data Preparation/Cleaning

Describe and justify the process for preparing the data for analysis.
Questions to consider:
* Were there variables you dropped or created?
* How did you address missing values or outliers?
* Why are these choices appropriate given the data and the business problem?
Here we are going to follow the steps below for data preparation:

In preparing the data for analysis in the context of understanding successful films at the box office, several steps were taken to ensure the data's quality, relevance, and reliability. Here's an overview of the data preparation process and the reasoning behind the decisions made:

a)Checking for missing data

b)Checking for outliers

c)Checking for duplicates

Then we data clean using the following techniques:

a)Handling Missing Values:
- **Imputation:** For missing values, common strategies like  median imputation for numerical variables imputation for categorical variables  have been used. Imputation techniques were chosen based on the nature of the missing data and their potential impact on the analysis.
- **Dropping Rows or Columns:** Rows with a high percentage of missing values or lacking critical information have been dropped .

b)Outlier Treatment:
- **Identification and Adjustment:** Outliers, if detected, could skew statistical analysis. Methods like trimming, capping, or using more robust statistical techniques (e.g., winsorization) might have been employed to address extreme values that could distort insights into movie success attributes.

c)Changing data types:
During data understanding we noticed that some gross columns were Objects instead of integers/floats this needs to be rectified inorder to visualize appropriately.

The data preparation process was critical to ensuring that the subsequent analysis provided meaningful insights into successful movie attributes at the box office, guiding decision-making for Microsoft's new movie studio venture.
